# football_hackathon2024

This GitHub repository has the code to our project for the 2024 MLDS Hackathon. 

Description: 

This project focuses on using Northwestern (and BIG 10) soccer match data to analyze and improve defensive structures. By utilizing data analytics, we aim to understand the defensive patterns that occured in wins vs losses, identify weaknesses, and propose potential improvements. The project uses both Python and R in order to create the necessary visualizations.
